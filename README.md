<h1>Rock-Paper-Scissors Python Game</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The goal of this project was to create a script in Python that would allow the user to play a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against an AI opponent named "Bobby" whose choice would be randomized each time. After the user makes their choice, Bobbys choice is revealed, and the screen will display whether the user was victorious or defeated, or if the game ended in a draw. At the conclusion of every game, the user is asked if they would like to play again and restart another game, or if they want to close out the application.
